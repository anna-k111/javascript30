# .gitignore

# this file tells Git which files and folders to ignore

# used to prevent tracking: 
# - system-specific files (windows cache or metadata)
# - generated files (build or log files)
# - dependencies (node_modules/)
# - sensitive info (.env with API keys)

# keeps the repo clean, secure, and focused on the relevant source code

# windows system files
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
Desktop.ini

# log files
*.log

# node dependencies 
node_modules/

# build folders (for later tooling, like bundlers)
dist/
build/

# environment variables
.env 

# ADDITIONAL NOTES

# windows system files - hidden files Windows creates automaticaly to manage folder views, thumbnails, other system-specific settings

# log files - generated by your program or tools to record events, errors, or debug info 
# logs are typically temporary and only useful for local troubleshooting 

# build folders - contain compiled or processed versions of your source code 
# generated automatically from your source files and can be rebuilt anytime 
# including them can cause sync issues in your repo 
# instead, track og source code and everyone can build their own copy
