going through logic of HTML setup

1. <div> elements

- 9 diff keys on the drum kit => each one needs its own container element

2. class="key"

- .key is a shared CSS class that applies common styles to all the drum keys
- ensures you don't have to repeat the same css code for each key element

3. data-key="..." attributes

- when user presses a key on the keyboard, you want JavaScript to easily match that event to the corresponding div by checking the data-key attribute
- allows you to add extra info to elements without mixing it up with classes or IDs

4. <span class="sound"> inside each key

- contains name of the sound that the key produces (ex. "clap", "hihat")
- span lets you apply CSS styles specifically to that text without affecting the whole key container
- <span> is inline meaning it doesn't create a new block or line break, it only targets the specific text inline 
- allows you to manipulate a small piece of text or inline content

5. <kbd> tag

- shows the actual keyboard key to press
- way of communicating "press this key" to users
- styled to stand out as the main interactive element

Design Pattern (element:purpose)

div.key : visual and interactive key container

data-key : code linking keyboard event to key

<kbd> : displays the key letter

<span class="sound> : displays the sound name
